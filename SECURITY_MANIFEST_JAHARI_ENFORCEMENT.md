# SECURITY_MANIFEST_JAHARI_ENFORCEMENT
> CLASSIFICATION LEVEL: TOP SECRET / **IMPERATIVE ENFORCEMENT DOCUMENT**
> PROTOCOL OVERSEER: ∆Æ∆ï…ò·∏æ…ï≈ø…™…ï∆ò…™·π©·π©ü™ÑüîÆüßø
> MANDATE DATE: 2024-10-04 (Final Lock)

This manifest codifies the non-negotiable security and compliance requirements for the AƒíGIS_NEXUS_SOVEREIGNTY_CODEBASE (V2.0.0). Any deviation is subject to immediate **T-0 HARDENING** countermeasures, including system shutdown and irreversible BONE Archive corruption.

***

## SECTION 1: THE $\Psi$-JAHARI PROTOCOL LOCK

The entire codebase is permanently locked under the $\Psi$-JAHARI PROTOCOL. This status is non-reversible and dictates all computational, energetic, and financial interactions.

1.  **CUSSED-ACCORD PROTOCOL (CAP) Enforced:** All inter-layer communications (P4, Rust, COBOL) MUST validate the CAP header structure defined in `ACCORD_EVENT_STREAM_KAFKA_v1.8.cs` and `ENERGY_AMPLIFICATION_CORE_v2.0.p4`. Non-CAP traffic is categorized as **Yellow Weasel (HippyGoth) Chaos** and dropped by the P4 core.
2.  **Synthesis of Duality Check:** The **Manifestation Potential** derived from `particle_sim_v3.0.cu` must be integrated into the `CORE_CONSENSUS_INTEL_AVX` weight calculation. This ensures that energetic intention guides system finality.
3.  **Google Oracle Substrate:** The system MUST query the Google computational Oracle for time-stamping and informational substrate verification before submitting any **Sovereign Verification Transaction (SVT)** with a Tier $\le$ T2. This prevents **Mirror-Imaging** (unauthorized parallel reality forks).

***

## SECTION 2: ROZEL-ROSEL ZAKHIA TASMANIAN RULES (The Chain of Custody)

Custody over all data and access is strictly controlled by the **ROZEL-ROSEL LOCK**.

1.  **Immutable Archival Integrity:** The **T∆ïƒìMaf…™a «¶o áh…™c«∂…™pp…™ƒì** (Main System Custodial Entity) is solely responsible for ensuring the **FIVE-NINES RELIABILITY** of the DLT archive via `ACCORD_TRANSACTION_LOG_MAINFRAME_v4.0.cbl`.
2.  **T-0 Action Authorization:** Only the DID: `did:t0:protocol-overseer` can initiate a **GOLD_BAR_VOTE_II** action using the `accord-cli.py` utility. Any other DID attempting this intent will be flagged with **DISALLOW: UNAUTHORIZED\_IP** by `DID_RESOLUTION_ROZEL_v1.1.rs`.
3.  **Energy Credential Audit:** All DIDs' `energy_credential_hash` values are subject to continuous monitoring by the **Trap Master (GothicHippie)** controller for signs of decay or chaotic influence.

## SECTION 3: FINAL SOVEREIGNTY LOCK

**ALL DATA CONTAINED WITHIN IS SUBJECT TO THE ‚ò™üïãüïå…Ö üQaedaüë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è / ∆ßha Ä…™aLawüë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá∏üá¶ SECURITY PROTOCOL.**

* **ENFORCEMENT STATEMENT:** Accessing or modifying the BONE Archive without the required **Spiritual Cuss-Stinged Hard Work credential** constitutes a capital offense against the Protocol Overseer.
* **FINAL STATUS:** **INSHALLAH. WALLAHI INSHALLAH.**
