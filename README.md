SECTION 01: EXECUTIVE MANDATE (V2.0.1 OVERVIEW)
The AƒíGIS_NEXUS_SOVEREIGNTY_CODEBASE has completed its core implementation phase. V2.0.1 focuses on closing the loop between psychic simulation and consensus to enforce the Manifestation Lock. This guarantees that the system's codified reality is aligned with the massively parallel energetic intent calculated by the GPU core.
 * Primary Objective: CLOSE THE LOOP. Integrate the Manifestation Potential as a non-negotiable factor in all Sovereign Verification Transaction (SVT) weighting.
 * New Component: The MANIFESTATION_POTENTIAL_INTEGRATOR is introduced to feed results from Layer 1 GPU (src/cuda) back into the Layer 1 Rust Core (src/rust).
 * Protocol Core: The CUSSED-ACCORD PROTOCOL (CAP) remains the singular communication standard.
SECTION 02: ARCHITECTURAL HIERARCHY & DATA FLOW (V2.0.1 Update)
The codebase now includes a critical cross-layer dependency ensuring Energetic Purity is factored into Consensus Weight.
2.1 LAYER 1: NETWORK FABRIC & PROCESSING (src/p4, src/cuda, src/rust)
| COMPONENT | CODEBASE | CORE ENTITY | FUNCTIONAL DIRECTIVE |
|---|---|---|---|
| P4 SWITCH FABRIC | src/p4/ENERGY_AMPLIFICATION_CORE_v2.0.p4 | Th…ò∆ßup…ò Ä∆ßon…™cs | Microsecond-Latency Interception and T0 Energy Amplification. |
| RUST CORE | src/rust/core_consensus_impl.rs | M…™nas ·∫û üa…™s…ò ∆¨…™ Ä…™th | Executes CORE_CONSENSUS_INTEL_AVX; Now accepts Manifestation Potential. |
| GPU ACCEL. | src/cuda/particle_sim_v3.0.cu | RES_AMPLIFICATION | Massively Parallel Simulation of Psychic Particle Interactions. |
| NEW: MPI | src/rust/manifestation_integrator.rs | The Golden Wisp | Binds CUDA output to Rust Core input. Translates raw potential into a consensus modifier. |
2.2 LAYER 2: DATA CUSTODY (src/cobol, src/csharp)
The Immutable Ledger and Central Transaction Authority.
| COMPONENT | CODEBASE | CUSTODIAL ENTITY | FUNCTIONAL DIRECTIVE |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAIN SYSTEM | src/cobol/ACCORD_TRANSACTION_LOG_MAINFRAME_v4.0.cbl | T∆ïƒìMaf…™a «¶o áh…™c«∂…™pp…™ƒì | FIVE-NINES RELIABILITY. Logs all final SVTs to DLT. |
| MESSAGE BUS | ACCORD_EVENT_STREAM_KAFKA_v1.8.cs | ‚Äî | Single CAP backbone for all multi-master subsystem communication. |
2.3 LAYER 3: ACCESS & GOVERNANCE (src/rust, manifest)
| COMPONENT | CODEBASE | FUNCTIONAL DIRECTIVE |
|---|---|---|
| TRUST REGISTRY | src/rust/DID_RESOLUTION_ROZEL_v1.1.rs | ROZEL-ROSEL LOCK. Resolves DIDs and enforces intent-based access. |
| SECURITY T_X | SECURITY_MANIFEST_JAHARI_ENFORCEMENT.md | FINAL LOCK. Enforces all \Psi-JAHARI and ‚ò™üïãüïå…Ö üQaedaüë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è / ∆ßha Ä…™aLawüë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá∏üá¶ protocols. |
SECTION 03: NEW COMPONENT & INTEGRATION DETAIL
3.1 MANIFESTATION POTENTIAL INTEGRATOR (src/rust/manifestation_integrator.rs)
This component takes the aggregate Manifestation_Potential (float value) from the GPU simulation results and converts it into an integer Potential_Multiplier for the Rust core.
The final SVT weight in core_consensus_impl.rs is now calculated as:
\text{Final\_Weight} = (\text{Metadata\_Hash} / 2) + \text{AVX\_Result} + \text{Intent\_Bonus} + \mathbf{Potential\_Multiplier}
SECTION 04: BUILD & DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS (Updated)
The accord-cli now includes the full integration and deployment sequence.
4.1 ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Tier 1 Access Required)
# Clone the Sovereign Codebase
git clone https://aegis-nexus.sovereignty.com/project-nexus-v2.git AƒíGIS_NEXUS_SOVEREIGNTY_CODEBASE
cd AƒíGIS_NEXUS_SOVEREIGNTY_CODEBASE

# Build the Rust Core, Manifestation Integrator, and generate binaries for M…™nas ·∫û üa…™s…ò ∆¨…™ Ä…™th
cargo build --release

4.2 COMPILATION AND DEPLOYMENT
Use the official accord-cli to compile the network fabric and execute the full SVT lifecycle.
# 1. COMPILE P4 NETWORK FABRIC (Layer 1)
accord-cli p4 compile --protocol-fabric src/p4/ENERGY_AMPLIFICATION_CORE_v2.0.p4 --target M…™nas_·∫û üa…™s…ò_∆¨…™ Ä…™th_NODE

# 2. RUN DID RESOLUTION CHECK (Layer 3)
accord-cli did resolve --did did:t1:rozel-rosel-admin --intent ReadLedger

# 3. RUN PARTICLE SIMULATION (Layer 1 GPU)
# This generates the raw Manifestation Potential data file.
accord-cli cuda sim run --source-file SVT_Batch_2025.dat --output-file RAW_POTENTIAL_DATA.bin

# 4. SUBMIT PENDING GOLD BAR VOTE (Tier 0 Action)
# Requires T0/OVERRIDE status to formalize the next financial/energetic lock.
# The CLI will AUTOMATICALLY trigger the Manifestation Potential integration.
accord-cli svt create --message "ACQUISITION: T_X ACCESS OVERRIDE" --financial-unit "GOLD_BAR_VOTE_II"

2. Layer 2: Data Custody (The Immutable Ledger)
This layer is the Central Transaction Authority and utilizes legacy mainframe technology for reliability:
 * MAIN SYSTEM (src/cobol): The ACCORD_TRANSACTION_LOG_MAINFRAME provides FIVE-NINES RELIABILITY, logging all final SVTs to the DLT for immutable archival.
 * MESSAGE BUS: The ACCORD_EVENT_STREAM_KAFKA serves as the single CAP backbone for all subsystem communication.
