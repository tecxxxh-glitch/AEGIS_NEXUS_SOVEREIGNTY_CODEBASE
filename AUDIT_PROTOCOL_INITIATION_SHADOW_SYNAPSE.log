* OWNER: SHADOW_SYNAPSE

********************************************************************************

### SECTION 01: MANDATE AND SCOPE

Pursuant to the **$\Psi$-JAHARI PROTOCOL** and the immediate post-deployment security requirements, a full external audit of the **AĒGIS_NEXUS_SOVEREIGNTY_CODEBASE** is mandatory.

The audit scope is **Comprehensive and Invasive**, covering the integrity of the **Synthesis of Duality** and the **Manifestation Lock**.

---

### SECTION 02: KEY AUDIT TARGETS (CODEBASE FOCUS)

The audit team is directed to focus on the following critical system files and validation points:

1.  **Immutability Check:** Validate `src/cobol/ACCORD_TRANSACTION_LOG_MAINFRAME_v4.0.cbl` to ensure the **FIVE-NINES RELIABILITY** ledger logic is truly immutable and resistant to retroactive modification.
2.  **Energetic Purity Loop:** Verify the integrity of the closed loop between:
    * `src/cuda/particle_sim_v3.0.cu` (Raw Potential generation).
    * `src/rust/manifestation_integrator.rs` (The Golden Wisp's multiplier calculation).
    * `src/rust/core_consensus_impl.rs` (Final weight integration).
3.  **T-0 Security Lock:** Attempt to circumvent the **ROZEL-ROSEL LOCK** in `src/rust/DID_RESOLUTION_ROZEL_v1.1.rs` using a T2 or T3 DID to execute a **GOLD\_BAR\_VOTE\_II** transaction.
4.  **Network Resilience:** Stress test the `src/p4/ENERGY_AMPLIFICATION_CORE_v2.0.p4` filter against high volumes of simulated **Yellow Weasel (HippyGoth)** traffic to confirm dropping efficiency.

---

### SECTION 03: ACCESS PROVISIONING

The audit team (designated as **The Silver Hand**) is granted temporary, time-locked **Tier 1 Access** for inspection only. They are explicitly **DISALLOWED** from T0 actions.

* **AUDIT DID:** `did:t1:silver-hand-audit-a`
* **INITIAL ACTION:** Run the `OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK_T0_LOCKDOWN.sh` to confirm the successful T-0 submission sequence.

**STATUS: AUDIT PROTOCOL ACTIVATED. ALL SYSTEM LOGS ARE NOW UNDER EXTERNAL MONITORING.**
**COMPLIANCE WARNING: FAILURE TO PASS AUDIT WILL INITIATE A MANDATORY CODEBASE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE.**
